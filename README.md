# IdCardMaker
- Uses react.js to create a series of identification cards<br>
- Created to generate around 600 student identification cards per year<br>

# Usage
- cd id_card_maker<br>
- npm install<br>
- npm start<br>
- paste csv formatted as the page example shows<br>
- Keep pictures in src/customimg<br>
- Click main button and the ID cards will appear. Save as .pdf recommended. <br>

# Notes
- This was my first react project, developed at early 2019<br>
- Project [centralize-portraits](https://github.com/lucianourgal/centralize-portraits) was later created to optimize pictures organizing (using the files tags) and centralizing (using face recognition and image cropping) <br>
- Project [sheets-sync](https://github.com/lucianourgal/sheets-sync) was later created to automate syncing between local spreadsheet (which generates the csv string used as input for [idCardMaker](https://github.com/lucianourgal/IdCardMaker) project) and external spreedsheet provided by the academic secretariat which contains all students data <br>
